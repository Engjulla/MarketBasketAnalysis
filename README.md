# Market Basket Analysis for an Asian chain restaurant in Cyprus

This repository houses the code and results from the Data Mining project carried out for Restaurant C, a popular restaurant in Nicosia, Cyprus. We explored several data mining techniques to provide the restaurant with actionable insights to enhance its operations, customer satisfaction, and profitability in the face of heightened competition and changing customer preferences.

# Objective:


Market Basket Analysis: Analyzed transaction data to identify frequently co-purchased products, providing insights into customer preferences and potential product combinations for new set menus.

Product Recommendation: Developed a product recommendation system based on market basket analysis and customer segmentation, promoting cross-selling and upselling opportunities


Customer Behavior Analysis: Compared purchasing behaviors of dine-in and delivery customers to identify significant differences in preferences and habits. These insights helped improve the delivery service and increase dine-in sales.


Strange Product Combinations: Identified unusual product combinations ordered together, revealing potential product pairings for marketing campaigns or set menus.


Consumption Patterns: Analyzed data to identify consumption patterns, guiding the development of new products or menu items aligned with customer preferences.


Customer Segmentation: Segmented customers based on their purchasing behavior and characteristics to tailor marketing strategies and promotions effectively.


# Data & Model: Apriori Algorithm


The dataset used for this project contains transactional information from Restaurant C. We used both numerical and categorical variables for the analysis.
The data mining strategy was based on the CRISP-DM methodology, starting with data understanding and moving on to data preparation, which included various operations to ensure data suitability for analysis.
We utilized Python and its libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The project's centerpiece, Market Basket Analysis, uses the concept of association rules to identify frequently co-purchased items. We applied the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets in the restaurant's sales data, generated association rules, and explored the frequent itemsets to identify data patterns. These analyses were visualized with network graphs to provide a clear view of customer ordering patterns.


# Results


The analyses provided valuable insights into customer preferences, behaviors, and consumption patterns. These insights were instrumental in making strategic decisions for operational improvements and increased profitability. By leveraging data mining techniques, Restaurant C was able to enhance its decision-making process, offering a data-driven approach to tackling the challenges faced in the competitive restaurant industry.
